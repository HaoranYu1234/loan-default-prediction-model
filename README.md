## Research proposal and planning

### Research motivation 🧐💰💵:
Understanding and predicting loan defaults is crucial for financial institutions to manage risk effectively. Accurate predictions can help in making informed lending decisions, reducing the occurrence of bad debts, and ensuring financial stability. Also by performing machine learning, lenders can refine their criteria for approving loans, ensuring that they are lending to individuals and businesses with a lower risk of default. This can lead to more responsible lending practices and a healthier credit market.
